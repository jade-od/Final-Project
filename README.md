# Proposal
Final project proposal

Include anything else you want to say, such as the difficulties you faced or overcame, the things you learned, what you enjoyed, etc, in a readme file.
    - In order to run the memory game you have to control K the contents in the Game Manager script. For the rest of the game to run you have to control K the Game Manager script to hashtag it all out. Some difficulties we overcame were figuring out how to work together on a Godot interface. Using videos from Godot 2 and 3 was a challenge seeing as they changed small details of the Godot interface. Unfortunately, we couldn't get to game 1.
