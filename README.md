Include anything else you want to say, such as the difficulties you faced or overcame, the things you learned, what you enjoyed, etc, in a readme file.
Jade O'Dowd- In order to run the memory game you have to control K the contents in the Game Manager script. For the rest of the game to run you have to control K the Game Manager script to hashtag it all out. Some difficulties we overcame were figuring out how to work together on a Godot interface. Using videos from Godot 2 and 3 was a challenge seeing as they changed small details of the Godot interface. Unfortunately, we couldn't get to game 1.

Olivia Walton- Learning to use Godot and it's different features was the hardest part of this project. I struggled a lot with getting things to actually work- and when they did work, they would eventually stop working for some reason I couldn't figure out. Every feature, event and node felt like it took an hour or more to implement correctly. During this project, I learned a lot about file paths and different ways to call different functions. I kept having to delete and rewrite the same things over and over, and nearing the end I sort of figured it out, but by that point it was time to submit. I really enjoyed making the sprites for this game- it was probably the most enjoyable part. Overall, I'm proud of our result and the effort we put in to making our game work.
